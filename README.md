# Hi! I'm Lewis :)

* ü§µ When it comes to 'work', I'm a Power Platform Consultant
* üíª I'm a bit of a low-code and tech obsessed geek / #PowerAddict
* üè´ I started my learning around Microsoft 365 & Business Applications whilst still at school and went straight into a Power Platform career working at a Gold Microsoft Partner
* üìπ I've previously been lucky enough to make an appearance on the Microsoft show #LessCodeMorePower with Dona Sarkar where I showcased some of my #PowerPlatform work whilst still being a Sixth Form / High School student - [Solving Classroom Emergency Situations Using Power Platform with Lewis Baybutt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIzEzz_4eFQ&t=59s)
